// Reads one small JSON file from redwardenstudios.com (see update-manifest.hpp)
// and, if it lists a newer version, the dock shows a one-line notice with a
// Download link. It NEVER downloads or runs anything itself: the user clicks
// through to the website and runs the signed installer, which upgrades in place
// and keeps every setting. Sends nothing but a plain GET whose User-Agent names
// the plugin version. Any failure (offline, timeout, bad JSON) is silent.

// Runs the one request on a worker thread and reports back on the UI thread.

// The worker alone owns its WinHTTP handles (closing a synchronous handle from
// another thread is unsupported). stop() - called from the dock's shutdown() -
// marks the check cancelled under a lock, so the worker can never post to the
// dock afterwards, then waits up to 1.5 s for it. If the network is still
// stuck, the plugin DLL is pinned in memory and the thread is detached: OBS
// exits without hanging, and the thread's code can't be unloaded under it.
